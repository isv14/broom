Sentinel Maus Type, designed by James Arboghast

A heavy duty block-shadow font derived from Sentinel Sten Type, Maus' inflexible, near-featureless block-like shapes give the impression of great mass and solidity. Maus is an example of minimalism in type design, using a minimum of sculpting to elicit the essence of familiar Latin forms. Two sets of complimentary letters allow designers to pick and choose combinations for letter fit, for their symmetric values, or to create a particular look or feel to suit the subject.

Obviously Maus has great potential for signage, posters and billboards, and screen-printed garments.
